=== HowTO run Application with rtld-audit'ing ===
= Approach #1
1) LD_AUDIT=<full path to audit lib> <application> , like:
$ LD_AUDIT=./audit.so ./app

otherwise:
$ LD_AUDIT=audit.so ./app 
ERROR: ld.so: object 'audit.so' cannot be loaded as audit interface: cannot open shared object file; ignored.
APP: Going to call greeting() from libfoo.so
libfoo: hello world

= Approach #2
In order not to specify environment variable LD_AUDIT when launchin the app,
I tried to add the following line into Makefile:
   APP_LDFLAGS := -Wl,--audit $(DIST_AUDIT) 
This does not help
